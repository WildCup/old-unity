Simple Platformer RPG game in unity (C#)

It's a Platformer RPG inspired by Shaun Spalding tutorials  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izNXbMdu348&list=PLPRT_JORnIupqWsjRpJZjG07N01Wsw_GJ
and using his assets https://shaunjs.itch.io/shauns-complete-platformer-tutorial-series

Hi's using GMS2 but I created this project in Unity (C#) from scratch by myself.
This project was created purly for studing purposes and it's free to be used by anybody.
I will update it when I have time since it's not finished and has a lot of bugs.
