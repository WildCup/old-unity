# Qubes

Simple game based on Brackyes tutorials.

Levels built by randomly spawning rectangles. Difficulty still increases up to level when it's impossible to go through.
You need to buy new skills and force your way through.
You can increase your skill level infinitely.

I'm going to add infinite number of levels soon.
